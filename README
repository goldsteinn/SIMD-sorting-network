Creates sorting network using avx
- epi8 / epi64 don't work (need to fix vec_sort_primitives.h blend at the very least)
- if you specify a sorting network that has more bytes than __m512i register its UB

get sorting networking from: https://pages.ripco.net/~jgamble/nw.html

Choose an algorithm i.e Batcher's Merge Exchange and copy the output to a file named:

- <anything without a "-">-<N>

#### do not include a file extension (or make create_network.py more robust)

$> ./create_network <your file>

will output C++ code for the sorting network that uses moderately optimized SIMD instructions (if you really need it optimized a lot of the permutations can be replaced with shuffle)
