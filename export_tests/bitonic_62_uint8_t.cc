	Underlying Sort Type             : uint8_t
	Network Generation Algorithm     : bitonic

	Optimization Preference          : space
	SIMD Type                        : __m512i
	SIMD Instruction Set(s) Used     : AVX512f, AVX512vbmi, AVX512bw
	SIMD Instruction Set(s) Excluded : None
	Aligned Load & Store             : True
	Integer Aligned Load & Store     : True
	Full Load & Store                : True
	Scaled Sorting Network           : False

Performance Notes:
1) If you are sorting an array where there IS valid memory up to 
   the nearest sizeof a SIMD register, you will get an improvement enable
   "EXTRA_MEMORY" (this turns on "Full Load & Store". Note that enabling
   "Full Load & Store" will not modify any of the memory not being sorted
   and will not affect the sort in any way. i.e sort(3) [4, 3, 2, 1]
   with full load will still return [2, 3, 4, 1]. Note even if you don't
   have enough memory for a full SIMD register, enabling "INT_ALIGNED"
   will also improve load efficiency and only requires that there is
   valid memory up the next factor of sizeof(int).

2) If your sort size is not a power of 2 you are likely running into 
   less efficient instructions. This is especially noticable when sorting
   8 bit and 16 bit values. If rounding you sort size up to the next
   power of 2 will not cost any additional depth it almost definetly
   worth doing so. The "Best" Network Algorithm automatically does this
   in many cases.

3) There are two optimization settings, "Optimization.SPACE" and 
   "Optimization.UOP". The former will essentially break ties by picking
   the instruction that uses less memory (i.e doesn't have to store
   a register's initializing in memory. The latter will break ties but
   simply selecting whatever instructions use the least UOPs. Which
   is best is probably application dependent. Note that while "Optimization.SPACE"
   will save .rodata memory it will often cost more in .text memory.
